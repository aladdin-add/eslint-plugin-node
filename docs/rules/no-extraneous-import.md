# Disallow `import` declarations which import extraneous modules (`n/no-extraneous-import`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): ðŸŸ¢ `recommended-module`, âœ… `recommended-script`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If an `import` declaration's source is extraneous (it's not written in `package.json`), the program works in local, but may not work after dependencies are re-installed. It will cause troubles to your team/contributors. If a declaration source is extraneous yet consistently works for you and your team, it may be a transitive dependency (a dependency of a dependency). Transitive dependencies should still be saved as an explicit dependency in `package.json` to avoid the risk of a dependency changing and removing the dependency of a dependency this `import` is relying on.

This rule disallows `import` declarations of extraneous modules.
